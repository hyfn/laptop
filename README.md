Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We've tried:

* OS X El Capitan (10.11)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
cd ~
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyfn/laptop/master/mac
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyfn/laptop/master/example-laptop.local
less example-laptop.local
mv example-laptop.local .laptop.local

sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].
You may also use [Garrett's local dotfile overrides][dotfiles-local] 

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles#install
[dotfiles-local]: https://github.com/garrettd714/dotfiles-local

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.

OS X El Capitan (10.11)
-----------------------

You may have problems installing Homebrew for the first time on OS X El
Capitan due to permission changes to the /usr directory (within which the Homebrew
installation is typically located). See the [Homebrew El Capitan troubleshooting instructions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/El_Capitan_and_Homebrew.md)
for steps to resolve the permissions issues that interfere with Homebrew's
installation.

**Note**: You shouldn't have any problems with a up-to-date machine as of 11/2015

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'

brew_cask_install_or_upgrade 'firefox'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
